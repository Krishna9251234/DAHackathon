🔗 Blockchain Purpose in This Project
The blockchain simulation serves as an immutable audit trail for green hydrogen credits:

Hash Chain Integrity: Each transaction creates a cryptographic hash linked to the previous one, making tampering impossible
Transparency: All credit movements (issue → transfer → retire) are permanently recorded
Trust Without Authority: Buyers can verify credit authenticity without trusting the producer
Carbon Credit Compliance: Prevents double-spending and ensures genuine environmental impact
📋 Complete Project Explanation
System Overview
A marketplace for Green Hydrogen Credits - digital certificates proving clean energy production that can be traded and retired for carbon offset compliance.

User Roles & Workflows
🏭 PRODUCER (HydroGreen Pvt Ltd)

Issues Credits: Creates new credits from green hydrogen production
Transfers Credits: Sells credits to buyers
Portfolio Management: Tracks issued vs sold credits
Batch Management: Groups credits by production runs
🏢 BUYER (SteelCo India)

Purchases Credits: Receives transferred credits from producers
Retires Credits: Uses credits for carbon compliance (permanent destruction)
Impact Tracking: Monitors CO2 savings from retired credits
Portfolio View: Active vs retired credit management
🔍 AUTHORITY (MNRE Verifier)

Ledger Auditing: Reviews all transactions for compliance
Blockchain Verification: Ensures ledger integrity using hash validation
Credit Investigation: Searches specific credit histories
System Oversight: Monitors total market statistics
Core Workflow
1. PRODUCER → Issues 10 solar credits (1000kg CO2 saved)
2. PRODUCER → Transfers 4 credits to BUYER
3. BUYER → Retires 2 credits for compliance
4. AUTHORITY → Verifies entire transaction chain
Technical Features
📊 Real-time Analytics

Market statistics (total issued/active/retired)
Top producers leaderboard
Environmental impact tracking
Interactive charts and visualizations
🔐 Blockchain Simulation

SHA-256 hash chain linking all transactions
Tamper detection and integrity verification
Immutable transaction history
Genesis block initialization
💼 Credit Lifecycle Management

Status tracking: ACTIVE → RETIRED/EXPIRED

🎯 Business Rules

Only active credits can be transferred/retired
Only owners can initiate transactions
All operations are atomic (succeed/fail together)
Retired credits cannot be reused (prevents double-counting)
Key Value Propositions
Environmental Compliance: Companies buy/retire credits to offset carbon footprint
Market Transparency: Blockchain ensures authentic green energy certificates
Regulatory Compliance: Authorities can audit the entire system
Economic Incentive: Producers monetize green hydrogen production
Trust & Verification: Cryptographic proof eliminates fraud
This creates a complete carbon credit marketplace with blockchain-backed authenticity for the green hydrogen economy.
